# pimp-daddy-music-player
There are many very nice open source audio players/embeddable html projects but none of them have everything I need. I want/need to build a custom player that can be used whether your a producer selling beats or an artist selling your original songs.

Most players are pretty basic and they all look pretty much the same. I want something that actually looks like an old analog reciever/some kind of web 3 modern upated version though. Think 2045 mercedes benz....lmao

The player needs the same functionality as the beatstars player so...email integration, that download button arrow that allows subs for free tagged downloads and the ability to administer contracts or delivery PDF docs with beat....etc. yada yada..

It occurs to me this could become an app over time prefferably a DAPP (accept ETH gas bro....) but for now functionality is key as I continue to build upon this player of all players......As long as I can showcase my music and build my audience I'm golden.

To cutting out the middle man! 

Cheers!
