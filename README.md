There are many very nice open source audio players/embeddable html projects but none of them have everything I need. I want/need to build a custom player that can be used whether your a producer selling beats or an artist selling your original songs. It needs to be able to accept crypto payments!

Most music players are pretty basic and they all look pretty much the same. I want something that actually looks like an old analog reciever/some kind of web 3 modern upated version. Think 2045 mercedes benz....lmao

I envision a waveform in between the speaker and the volume knob, I am experimenting with wavesurfer.js, howler.js and wfplayer.js (I intend to add video and have a waveform play for that as well.) to start out. I would also like to have the speaker pulse everytiime the drum hits. The volume knob needs to (ideally) turn from min. to max. I'm sure up and down arrows could work but then it wouldn't be the [P.D.M.P]-LOL  

The player needs to have similar functionality to the beatstars player so...email integration, that download button arrow that allows subs for free tagged downloads and the ability to administer contracts or deliver ZIPS and PDF docs with beat....etc. yada yada..

Obviously the next and prev buttons need to skip the track. I like the idea of a drop down playlist but we will see. I imagine a track image, waveform, title, author, and time populating above the play button for each audio track. Same minus the image for video.

It occurs to me this could become an app over time prefferably a DAPP (accept ETH gas bro....) but for now functionality is key as I continue to build upon this player of all players......As long as I can showcase my music and build my audience I'm golden.

To cutting out the middle man! WISH ME LUCK!!!

Cheers!
